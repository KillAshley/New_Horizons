About
-----
New Horizons is a planet pack for Kerbal Space Program. Originally designed as a small project to help KillAshley get back into the game.

This pack completely rearranges the stock system and introduced 19 more bodies to visit and explore, along with compatibility and many features to improve gameplay.


Instructions
------------
Firstly, ensure any older version of NH and Kopernicus have been removed.

You will need to DELETE (important) the following folders when updating:
- GameData/Kopernicus
- Gamedata/New_Horizons

You will need to download it's dependency - Kopenicus. This is required to run the mod.
Just download the latest release, & and hotfixes available.

DO NOT install the Kopernicus Examples folder in the Kopernicus download.

Simply merge the downloaded .zip files into your KSP directory the same as with any other mod.
DO NOT EXTRACT THE .zip FILE STRAIGHT OUT - open it and merge the contents.
This should be all you are required to do for a basic install.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO BACKUP YOUR SAVEGAMES BEFORE INSTALLATION/UPDATING AS BUGS CAN & SOMETIMES DO OCCUR.

if you need to reset your ships landed on planets before/after updating, please use hyperedit as it makes resetting them simple and easy.


Optional Extras
