		ErnusSrfLandedMeltedFace = The sample here melts the container you put it into; maybe Tupperware wasn't the best choice.
		ErnusSrfLandedWhiteFlows = You decide white hot molten rock is probably not safe to handle, and quickly decide going home empty handed will be easier.
		ErnusSrfLandedRidgelands = As the ground shifts uncomfortably under you, you decide it's time to get back on the ship.
		ErnusSrfLandedSurface = The ground here is a gooey mess, making the sample stick to everything.

		ArinSrfLandedWastes = You find the sand here is surprisingly similar to that back home on Kerbin. You consider stopping to make sandcastles, but KSC tells you to hurry up.
		ArinSrfLandedLowlands = The sand in the lowlands seems much more compacted than the wastes.
		ArinSrfLandedPolarCrater = You find remains of the meteorite that impacted Arin and determine it must have come from deep space.
		ArinSrfLandedMainlandCraters = You take a sample from the impact site, determined that this time you won’t lose it on the way back to the ship.
		ArinSrfLandedNorthernCrater = It seems the ground here has been covered over. The impact that caused the crater must have occurred a millennia ago.
		ArinSrfLandedTwinCraters = Rock samples show that this impact was cause by a single asteroid that must have split in two before impact.
		ArinSrfLandedCentralCrater = The sample here definitely tastes different to the rest of the planet.
		
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = The surface appears to covered in a fine layers of dust and rocks.
		AstidSrfLandedValley = You desperately try to brag samples before you start tumbling down the slope.
		AstidSrfLandedDepths = As you scoop a sample into the container you become unnerved by the blood red color.

		DersoSrfLandedAlphaImpactSite = The surface here is covered in a dense glass-like substance created by this colossal impact, making a sample hard to get.
		DersoSrfLandedImpactedFlatlands = You try to take a sample of the fine dust covering this area, but it just floats away before you can get it into the container.
		DersoSrfLandedCrateredLowlands = The samples here show an abundance of minerals and metals, probably brought here from the asteroids that smashed into the surface.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = The sample of the ridges on the surface shows that this planet was once covered in these steep hills before it was demolished by the alpha impact.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = I'm sure the exposed stone in this area will provide valuable insight about the history and composition of Derso.

		ApturSrfLandedLowlands = The dust seems magnetic, and won't come off the sampling instrument. You just place the sampling instrument into the sample bay, and hope that the scientists can figure out how to remove the dust later on.
		ApturSrfLandedMidlands = The dust keeps going into suborbital trajectories, rather than being scooped up.
		ApturSrfLandedHighlands = The scientists are yammering on about "Pyroxenes" and "Pervoskites", but all you can think of is what snack you'll be eating back in the ship. 
		
		SerranSrfLandedDesertedShores = Samples from the shores show that the erosion of the surface was due to massive sink-holes developing over millennia.
		SerranSrfLandedMidlandCraters = Compositions vary greatly in the craters, showing impacts ranging in materials.
		SerranSrfLandedMainland = The surface here is so blue you can help but have a quick taste. Mission control asks what flavour it is.
		SerranSrfLandedTwinCraters = The bed of the craters look roughly the same, so naturally you conclude the same asteroid must have bounced when it landed!
		SerranSrfLandedPolarImpact = Why did an asteroid impact all the way down here? It's so cold!
		SerranSrfLandedBleachedLand = The surface sample appears hard and clumpy. There appears to be large levels of metals in the ground here.

		LaveSrfLandedSnowlands = Initial interpretation of small patches of yellow snow warrants caution should future experiments require taste tests.
		LaveSrfLandedSlopes = Initial observations of the sample are that this planet is definitely not Kerbin.
		LaveSrfLandedSmallImpactSites = There appears to be liquid hidden slightly under the surface. While it appears to be similar to water, the taste-test Mission Control has ordered has you worried.
		LaveSrfLandedLargeImpactSites = The material in the craters appears to have been exposed to high temperature and pressure. This is consistent with them being formed by impacts.
		LaveSrfLandedSurface = Detailed analysis of this surface soil should allow KSC to easy identify the optimal holiday camp sites.

		NolasSrfLandedIcySurface = The ice is very hard and strong, and without letting Werner see, you simply place an empty bag in the sample box.
		NolasSrfLandedMountainRanges = The sample dissolves all of your bags, so you just place it in the sample bay, confident it will be fine.

		TitanusSrfLandedShores = Sandy Snow! Eww!
		TitanusSrfLandedHeavyWaters = Its solid ice, and you struggle to take a sample.
		TitanusSrfLandedOmegaImpact = The rocks here are fractured, due to the impact.
		TitanusSrfLandedOmegaOcean = We weren't allow to take a sample here.
		
		EteSrfLandedFlats = If Minmus is mint flavoured, is this moon blueberry?
		EteSrfLandedSlopes = A large sheet of ice, several meters in length, breaks off the slope. Despite mission controls orders, you try to place it in the sample container. It's fine if its hanging out of the bay, right?
		EteSrfLandedPeaks = You take a sample off the highest point of the tallest mountain, and hope it will be preserved in a museum somewhere on Kerbin. 
		
		OreeSrfLandedLowlands = The surface is composed of a brown gunk, with white particles of ice mixed in.
		OreeSrfLandedSlopes = This tastes nothing like chocolate!
		OreeSrfLandedHighlands = The goo eats the sample before you can get it into the sample bay! 
		
		TidusSrfLandedCliffs = This sand is the perfect consistency for sandcastles.
		TidusSrfLandedLowArctic = You try to throw a snowball at your fellow kerbal, but the atmosphere stops it before it gets close.
		TidusSrfLandedArcticSlopes = you are to engrossed in Skiing to pick up a sample.
		TidusSrfLandedArcticHighlands = Snow. We went all this way, to find snow. 
		TidusSrfSplashedTidalOcean = You catch a small fish, and carefully place them into the sample container.
		TidusSrfSplashedCliffs = You confirm that water acts the same on all worlds, as it still dramatically increases the surface humidity of any surface it touches.
		
		EtalSrfLandedFlats = The surface is compacted ice and dust.
		EtalSrfLandedSlatedGround = Your collection shovel cannot penetrate the surface material.
		EtalSrfLandedHighlands = The regolith here is quite ordinary.
		EtalSrfLandedPolarHeights = Some of the crystals are glowing!
		EtalSrfLandedGreatRidge = Some of the ice has collected into clumps, that are perfect for throwing at your fellow Kerbals!
