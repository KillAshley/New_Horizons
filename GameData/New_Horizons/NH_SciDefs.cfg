		ErnusSrfLandedMeltedFace = The sample here melts the container you put it into; maybe Tupperware wasn't the best choice.
		ErnusSrfLandedWhiteFlows = You decide white hot molten rock is probably not safe to handle, and quickly decide going home empty handed will be easier.
		ErnusSrfLandedRidgelands = As the ground shifts uncomfortably under you, you decide it's time to get back on the ship.
		ErnusSrfLandedSurface = The ground here is a gooey mess, making the sample stick to everything.

		ArinSrfLandedWastes = You find the sand here is surprisingly similar to that back home on Kerbin. You consider stopping to make sandcastles, but KSC tells you to hurry up.
		ArinSrfLandedLowlands = The sand in the lowlands seems much more compacted than the wastes.
		ArinSrfLandedPolarCrater = You find remains of the meteorite that impacted Arin and determine it must have come from deep space.
		ArinSrfLandedMainlandCraters = You take a sample from the impact site, determined that this time you wonâ€™t lose it on the way back to the ship.
		ArinSrfLandedNorthernCrater = It seems the ground here has been covered over. The impact that caused the crater must have occurred a millennia ago.
		ArinSrfLandedTwinCraters = Rock samples show that this impact was cause by a single asteroid that must have split in two before impact.
		ArinSrfLandedCentralCrater = The sample here definitely tastes different to the rest of the planet.
		
		AstidSrfLandedRockface = The surface appears to covered in a fine layers of dust and rocks.
		AstidSrfLandedValley = You desperately try to brag samples before you start tumbling down the slope.
		AstidSrfLandedDepths = As you scoop a sample into the container you become unnerved by the blood red color.

		DersoSrfLandedAlphaImpactSite = The surface here is covered in a dense glass-like substance created by this colossal impact, making a sample hard to get.
		DersoSrfLandedImpactedFlatlands = You try to take a sample of the fine dust covering this area, but it just floats away before you can get it into the container.
		DersoSrfLandedCrateredLowlands = The samples here show an abundance of minerals and metals, probably brought here from the asteroids that smashed into the surface.
		DersoSrfLandedSurface = The sample of the ridges on the surface shows that this planet was once covered in these steep hills before it was demolished by the alpha impact.
		DersoSrfLandedHighlands = I'm sure the exposed stone in this area will provide valuable insight about the history and composition of Derso.

		SerranSrfLandedDesertedShores = Samples from the shores show that the erosion of the surface was due to massive sink-holes developing over millennia.
		SerranSrfLandedMidlandCraters = Compositions vary greatly in the craters, showing impacts ranging in materials.
		SerranSrfLandedMainland = The surface here is so blue you can help but have a quick taste. Mission control asks what flavour it is.
		SerranSrfLandedTwinCraters = The bed of the craters look roughly the same, so naturally you conclude the same asteroid must have bounced when it landed!

		SerranSrfLandedBleachedLand = The surface sample appears hard and clumpy. There appears to be large levels of metals in the ground here.

		LaveSrfLandedSlopes = Initial observations of the sample are that this planet is definitely not Kerbin.

		LaveSrfLandedLargeImpactSites = The material in the craters appears to have been exposed to high temperature and pressure. This is consistent with them being formed by impacts.
		LaveSrfLandedSurface = Detailed analysis of this surface soil should allow KSC to easy identify the optimal holiday camp sites.

		NolasSrfLandedIcySurface = The ice is very hard and strong, and without letting Werner see, you simply place an empty bag in the sample box.
		NolasSrfLandedMountainRanges = The sample dissolves all of your bags, so you just place it in the sample bay, confident it will be fine.
		NolasSrfLandedTectonicCracks = The sample looks like brown snow. I will say no more.
		
		LeouchSrfLandedLowlands = The surface here is very sticky.

		LeouchSrfLandedFracturedLand = The samples keep breaking.
		LeouchSrfLandedCanyonEdge = Mission control asks you: "How?"
		LeouchSrfLandedPlanetaryCore = The sample is very hot, and mildly radioactive.
		
		TitanusSrfLandedHighlands = Snow, and some small pebbles. This would really hurt if you threw it at someone.
		TitanusSrfLandedMainlands = You throw the sample of snow at your crewmate. Due to a combination of high atmospheric drag and high gravity, it falls just a foot away from you.
		TitanusSrfLandedShores = Sandy Snow! Eww!
		TitanusSrfLandedHeavyWaters = Its solid ice, and you struggle to take a sample.
		TitanusSrfLandedOmegaImpact = The rocks here are fractured, due to the impact.
