		EliInSpaceLowSlopes = These slopes look very difficult to land on.
		EliInSpaceLowCraters = These craters look deep for a world of this size, perhaps Eli has a low density?

		ArinLandedLowlands = The sand reacts just as you would expect. Nothing is found.
		ArinLandedWastes = Extremeophile bacteria just cling to life here, protected from solar radiation inside rocks.
		ArinLandedMainlandCraters = The drill struggles to get a sample of the gravel into the chambre, as the gravel doesn't fit inside the drill.
		ArinLandedPolarCrater = In Arin's colder polar zones, a small community of microscopic organisms eeks out a living between sand grains.
		ArinLandedNorthernCrater = The sand releases some volatiles, probably from the decomposition of organic remains.
		ArinLandedTwinCrater = The sand here is completely abiotic.
		ArinLandedCentralCrater = The sand here is completely abiotic. 
		
		SerranLandedMainland = Some bacteria are present, but nothing particularly advanced
		SerranLandedMidlandCraters = No activity is detected.
		SerranLandedTwinCraters = Wait, was that.... no, nothing.
		SerranLandedPolarImpact = Nada, zilch, zip.
		SerranLandedDesertedShores = Some microbial activity, possible, maybe?
		SerranLandedWhiteLands = The sample contains a lot of photosynthetic bacteria, adapted to the high salt content.
		
		LaveLandedSurface = The sample melts into a purple mud, releasing a cloud of yellow chlorine gas. This combines with the water to form a powerful acid, which destroys the sample chamber.
		LaveLandedSlopes = The sample again destroys the sample chamber as a powerful acid is created.
		laveLandedSnowlands = The sample sublimes into a yellow gas, the sudden increase in pressure ruptures the sample chamber.
		LaveLandedSmallImpactSites = The sample melts into a purple mud, releasing a cloud of yellow chlorine gas. This combines with the water to form a powerful acid, which destroys the sample chamber.
		LaveLandedLargeImpactSites = The sample melts into a purple mud, releasing a cloud of yellow chlorine gas. This combines with the water to form a powerful acid, which destroys the sample chamber.
		
		LeouchSrfLandedLowlands = The surface releases some carbon monoxide, but that doesn't indicate anything biological.
